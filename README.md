## Resources and Tips
Below are a list of resources for chess enthusiasts of all skill levels to improve their game-
### Noobs (<800)
- **General Play**
  - Think "checks, captures, threats" every move
  - You're mostly not able to hold your pieces, and you're losing them either because the opponent attacked them, and you didnt see, or the opponent forked 2 pieces who both were undefended. So whenever developing pieces, ensure that they are defended.

  - Never resign! (against players at your level and within reason). People blunder a lot, be ready to take advantage!
  - Play as many online games as you can, your best way to increase your level is to keep playing, gaining experience, and analysing your games after the match, and try not to repeat those mistakes again.

- **Opening**
  - Stick to principles! Develop all your pieces, control the centre, avoid moving the same piece twice, castle quickly, do not move too many pawns on the side you've castled.
  - Development: Two ways to develop by pushing the pawns ahead to gain more area of the board by placing pieces on active squares from their initial position.
  - To control the center, try not exchanging your center pawns with side pawns (also called flank pawns).
  - Make sure to castle your king. If your opponent hasnt castled, and you have, then try to open up the center so that the enemy king is exposed.
  - DO NOT study predefined openings, only play with your logic and opening principles.

- **Middle Game**
  - Keep looking for undefended pieces of the opponent, try to fork (attack simultaneously) two or more pieces so that you can take one of them

- **End Game**
  - Study the Two queens/rooks vs lone king endgame
  - In the end game, if there are pawns on both sides, then bishops are better than knights, but if they're one side, knights are better, that's because your bishops can keep an eye on both sides.

### Beginners (800-1300)
- **General Play and Openings**
  - Do not hang pieces!
  - Never play f6
  - Try to take chances in your casual games,eg. try to play gambits or openings that are conjugate to your preferred style of play, you'll learn many different styles of play that way. Or for eg. try to sometimes exchange queen for a rook and bishop.	
  - [Instead of particular openings, you can read about different opening systems: Ten-system-openings](https://www.chess.com/forum/view/for-beginners/ten-system-openings)
  - [Opening Ideas/Theory - GM Yasser Seirawan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WEFr1dwqys&list=PLVWaFpMwtaGiVZ77NhhvGGGzvF7oFSWcA&index=6)
  - [Strategic ideas in the opening](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ohf79-nlekc&list=PLVWaFpMwtaGiVZ77NhhvGGGzvF7oFSWcA&index=13)

- **Middle Game**
  - [Improve your tactics](https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/wiki/resources#wiki_tactics)  
  - Ask your pieces if they are happy at their positions, and if not, ask them, where would they be the happiest, and then think about how you can achieve that. Try to keep maximum pieces 'happy' on the board, this will improve your position	
  - Make sure to castle your king. If your opponent hasnt castled, and you have, then try to open up the center so that the enemy king is exposed.

- **End Game**
  - King and pawn endgames. Recognize wins and draws
  - Common piece mates (KQ vs K, KR vs K)
  - In the end game, if there are pawns on both sides, then bishops are better than knights, but if they're one side, knights are better, that's because your bishops can keep an eye on both sides.
